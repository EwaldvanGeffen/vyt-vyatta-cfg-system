802.3ad                IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation (Default)
active-backup          Fault tolerant: only one slave in the bond is active
broadcast              Fault tolerant: transmits everything on all slave interfaces
round-robin            Load balance: transmit packets in sequential order
transmit-load-balance  Load balance: adapts based on transmit load and speed
adaptive-load-balance  Load balance: adapts based on transmit and receive plus ARP
xor                    Load balance: distribute based on MAC address
